# opt-polyethylene
Project for In2Research.


This repository contains code for the random generation and subsequent relaxation of polyethylene using an AIREBO potential.
Random generation involves production of N-length CH2 links, restricted in the X-Y plane and infinitely propogating through the Z-axis (emulated through looped boundaries).
